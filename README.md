# Stretch CSS Gridsystem

Stretch is a super simple responsive CSS grid system. For now, it is a 12 column grid that can have any gutter size you want. Columns can be pushed and pulled to make manoeuvring content really easy and breakpoints can be customised. The naming of classes is readable and easy to understand.

I hope people find this helpful.

## Getting Started

Stretch can be implemented in two ways: either use the `.scss` stylesheet in this repository compile it to CSS; or, link the `.css` file in your HTML document's head:

```<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/stretch.css">```
